# A sorting algorithm to optimize time complexity 
# in this project i had the chance to learn about a lot of sorting algorithms (buble sort , quick sort , radix sort...)
# and actually i did a good job in that , while i got stuck on finishing the project i did a quick search on how the sorting happens 
# and that takes me to think on sorting the stack we have with help of an other also by merging the bubble sort algorithm that i used to index my nodes to keep track on them 
# and of course i did it . so go ahead and check it.
